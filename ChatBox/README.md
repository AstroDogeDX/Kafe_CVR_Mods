# ChatBox

Latest Release: [ChatBox.dll](https://github.com/kafeijao/Kafe_CVR_Mods/releases/latest/download/ChatBox.dll)

The mod adds a text ChatBox over the player's head, allowing them to send messages to each other via keyboard input or
by clearing the ChatBox. ChatBoxes of other players will only be visible by default if they are friends, but this can be
adjusted in the Quick Menu. The mod also allows players to customize the display duration, size, and opacity of the
ChatBox. You can bring the keyboard by pressing `Y` or by using the Quick Menu.
