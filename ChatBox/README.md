# ChatBox

Latest Release: [ChatBox.dll](https://github.com/kafeijao/Kafe_CVR_Mods/releases/latest/download/ChatBox.dll)

The mod adds a text ChatBox over the player's head, allowing them to send messages to each other via keyboard input.
ChatBoxes of other players can be configured to display only from your friends (off by default), note that everyone will
be able to see your ChatBoxes.

The mod also allows players to customize the display duration, size, and opacity of the ChatBox. You can bring the 
keyboard by pressing `Y` or by using the button in BTKUI Misc section.

You can toggle the sounds for when someone starts typing and send a message. You can replace the sounds in the
`/UserData/Chatbox/` folder (next to the `/Mods` folder). Also you can customize the distance when you stop hearing the
notifications and volume.
