# Instances

Instances is a mod for ChilloutVR that enhances the management of world instances. With this mod, you can quickly rejoin
the last instance you were in before logging out (as long as it still exists), and easily revisit the last 12 instances
you've visited with just a single click. Note that to use the history feature, you need to have the BTKUILib mod
installed.

Requires [BTKUILib](https://github.com/BTK-Development/BTKUILib)

## Features

* Join the last instance you were in before logging out (if it still exists).
* Keep a history of the last 8 visited instances that you can rejoin with a single click.
